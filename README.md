   git clone https://github.com/sampsmith/Flex.git
   cd Flex001
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Basler Pylon SDK** (commercial license required)
   - Download from [Basler AG](https://www.baslerweb.com/)
   - Follow installation instructions for your platform

4. **Configure your hardware**
   - Connect Basler cameras
   - Set up relay module on COM port
   - Configure model paths in settings

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```


## Key Features

- **Dual Detection**: Handles both nail detection and board alignment simultaneously
- **Industrial Cameras**: Works with Basler cameras - both hardware-triggered and timed modes
- **Real-time Processing**: Uses GPU acceleration for speedy YOLO inference
- **Fault Logging**: Keeps track of all defects in a SQLite database
- **Hardware Control**: Automatically triggers relays when defects are found
- **Clean Code**: Modular architecture that's easy to maintain and extend
- **User-friendly Interface**: PySide6 GUI with real-time visualisation

## What You'll Need

### Hardware
- Basler cameras (compatible with Basler Pylon SDK)
- Relay module for hardware control
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended, but CPU-only mode works too)

## Configuration

The application uses a settings dialog to configure:
- Model paths for nail and board detection
- Pixel to millimetre conversion ratios
- Target measurements and tolerances
- Confidence thresholds
- Relay communication settings

## Usage

1. Start the application
2. Configure your models and settings via the Settings dialog
3. Select cameras for nail and board detection
4. Start the detection process
5. Monitor results and fault history

## Fault Management

The system automatically logs all detected faults to a SQLite database, including:
- Timestamp of detection
- Type of fault (nail or board alignment)
- Image index
- Detailed information
- Measurement data (for board alignment)

## Hardware Integration

### Cameras
- Supports Basler cameras with Pylon SDK
- Hardware-triggered mode for board alignment
- Timed capture mode for nail detection

### Relay Control
- Automatic relay triggering on defect detection
- Configurable COM port and baud rate
- Custom relay commands for your hardware

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Camera not detected**: Ensure Pylon SDK is properly installed
- **Model loading errors**: Check model file paths in settings
- **Relay communication**: Verify COM port and baud rate settings

### Logs
Check the `logs/` directory for detailed application logs.
